The portion of the log statement that 
Sleuth adds is [slueth-sample,44462edc42f2ae73,44462edc42f2ae73,false]. 

What do all these values mean? The first part is the 
application name (whatever you set spring.application.name to in bootstrap.yml). 
The second value is the trace id. 
The third value is the span id. 
Finally the last value indicates 
whether the span should be exported to Zipkin (more on Zipkin later).
